Computational Physics paper on the Energy Spectrum of Quantum Spin Chains

This paper was written in 1997 as the third project (out of 5) in a 3rd year
undegraduate physics class I took in Computational Physics. 

The paper was reformatted to use an IEEE template.
So apart from the adding of figures/table environments and changing the source code 
listings to use a modern LaTeX package (listings) the paper is otherwise unchanged.

The code for the class had to be written in FORTRAN 77 which I have included in
the repository. I haven't had time to recompile the FORTRAN source code to
replicate the results. On the the to-do list (or might rewrite it using
Python/NumPy/SciPy). 

Part of the class assignment was to use existing FORTRAN library functions for
matrix diagonalisation. The library functions were provided to the students but
were obtained from the
